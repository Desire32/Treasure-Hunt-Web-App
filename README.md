# Treasure Hunt Web App

Project: Mobile Web App for a "Treasure Hunt" Game

This project involved creating a mobile web application designed for playing a "Treasure Hunt" game. The app is intended to be an interactive online quiz, where players must locate real-world information to answer various questions.

# Main Features:
1. Cross-Platform Support: Built using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript, the app is compatible with modern mobile devices.
2. API Usage: The app communicates with an API to retrieve questions and submit answers. Questions are delivered one by one, with the next question unlocked only after the previous one is answered correctly.
3. Geolocation Requirement: Players must be in the correct location (verified by latitude and longitude data) for their answers to be accepted, preventing random guessing.
4. Various Question Types: The app supports different question formats, including text, numerical, Boolean, and multiple-choice.
5. User-Centric Design: Emphasis was placed on a user-friendly interface, adhering to UX/UI best practices.
6. Team Collaboration: Development was done collaboratively with the team using GitHub to manage contributions and teamwork.
7. Testing Strategy: A dedicated page outlines the testing approach, including unit tests and a plan for user acceptance testing.
